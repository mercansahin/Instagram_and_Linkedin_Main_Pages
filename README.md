### Instagram_and_Linkedin_Main_Pages

In this project, modern and engaging user experiences have been created using Bootstrap, inspired by Instagram and LinkedIn homepage designs. The interfaces are designed to be modern, aesthetic, and user-friendly, following responsive design principles.
Both projects ensure visual harmony and smoothness with custom CSS styles. These projects are a great resource for those who want to showcase their web development skills and gain experience with Bootstrap.
